Koin brings a simple API to let you define instances that are tied to a limit lifetime.

## What is a scope?

Scope is a fixed duration of time or method calls in which an object exists.
Another way to look at this is to think of scope as the amount of time an objectâ€™s state persists.
When the scope context ends, any objects bound under that scope cannot be injected again (they are dropped from the container).

## Scope definition

By default in Koin, we have 3 kind of scopes:

- `single` definition, create an object that persistent with the entire container lifetime (can't be dropped).
- `factory` definition, create a new object each time. Short live. No persistence in the container (can't be shared).
- `scoped` definition, create an object that persistent tied to the associated scope lifetime.

To declare a scoped definition, use the `scoped` function like follow. A scope gathers scoped definitions as a logical unit of time:

```dart
module()..scopeWithType(named('A Scope Name'),(scope){
  scope.scoped((s) => ComponentA());
});
```
:::note
A scope require a _qualifier_ to help name it. It can be either a String Qualifier, either a TypeQualifier
:::

Declaring a scope for a given type, can be done:

```dart
module()..scopeWithType(named<MyType>(),(scope){
  scope.scoped((s) => ComponentA());
});
```

or can even declared directly like this:

```dart
module()..scope<MyType>((scope){
  scope.scoped((s) => ComponentA());
});
```

## Using a Scope

Let's have those classes

```dart
class A {}
class B {}
class C {}
```

### Declare a Scoped Instance

Let's scope `B` & `C` instances from `A`, `B` & `C` instances are tied to a `A` instance:

```dart
module()
  ..factory((s) => A())
  ..scope<A>((scope) {
    scope.scoped((s) => B());
    scope.scoped((s) => C());
  });
```

### Create a scope and retrieve dependencies

Below is how we can create scope & retrieve dependencies

```dart
// Get A from Koin's main scope
var a = koin.get<A>()

// Get/Create Scope for `a`
var scopeForA = a.getOrCreateScope();

// Get scoped instances from `a`
var b = scopeForA.get<B>();
var c = scopeForA.get<C>();
```

We use the `getOrCreateScope` function, that will create a scope define by the type.
:::note
Note here that `scopeForA` is tied to `a` instance object
:::note

### Using the `scope` property

```dart
// Get A from Koin's main scope
var a = koin.get<A>()

// Get scoped instances from `a`
var b = a.scope.get<B>()
var c = a.scope.get<C>()
```

### Destroy scope and linked instances

```dart
// Destroy `a` scope & drop `b` & `c`
a.closeScope();
```

We use the `closeScope` function, to drop current scope & related scoped instances.

## More about Scope API

### Working with a scope

A scope instance can be created with as follow: `var scope = koin.createScope(id,qualifier);`. `id` is a ScopeId and `qualifier` the scope qualifier.

To resolve a dependency using the scope we can do it like:

* `var presenter = scope.get<Presenter>()` - directly using the get/inject functions from the scope instance

### Create & retrieve a scope

From your `Koin` instance you can access:

- `createScope(id : ScopeID, scopeName : Qualifier)` - create a closed scope instance with given id and scopeName
- `getScope(id : ScopeID)` - retrieve a previously created scope with given id
- `getOrCreateScope(id : ScopeID, scopeName : Qualifier)` - create or retrieve if already created, the closed scope instance with given id and scopeName

:::important
Make the difference between a scope instance id, which is the id to find your scope over all your scopes, and the scope name, which is the reference to the tied scope group name.
:::


### Resolving dependencies within a scope

The interest of a scope is to define a common logical unit of time for scoped definitions. It's allow also to resolve definitions from within the given scope

```dart
// given the classes
class ComponentA {}

class ComponentB {
  final ComponentA componentA;

  ComponentB(this.componentA);
}


// module with scope
module()
  ..scopeWithType(named("A_SCOPE_NAME"), (scope) {
    scope.scoped((s) => ComponentA());
    // will resolve from current scope instance
    scope.scoped((s) => ComponentB(s.get()));
  });
```

The dependency resolution is then straight forward:

```dart
// create an closed scope instance "myScope1" for scope "A_SCOPE_NAME"
var myScope1 = koin.createScope("myScope1",named("A_SCOPE_NAME"));

// from the same scope
var componentA = myScope1.get<ComponentA>();
var componentB = myScope1.get<ComponentB>();
```
:::important
By default, all scope fallback to resolve in main scope if no definition is found in the current scope
:::

### Closing a scope

Once your scope instance is finished, just closed it with the `close()` function:

```dart
// from a KoinComponent
var session = getKoin().createScope("session");

// use it ...

// close it
session.close();
```
:::important
Beware that you can't inject instances anymore from a closed scope.
:::

### Getting scope's source value

Koin Scope API in 2.1.4 allow you to pass the original source of a scope, in a definition. Let's take an example below.
Let's have a singleton instance `A`:

```dart
class A {}

class BofA {
  final A a;

  BofA(this.a);
}

var myModuleA = module()..single((s) => A())
  ..scope<A>((scope) {
    scope.scoped((s) => BofA(s.getSource()));
  });
```

By creating A's scope, we can forward the reference of the scope's source (A instance), to underlying definitions of the scope: `scoped { BofA(getSource()) }` or even `scoped { BofA(get()) }`

This in order to avoid cascading parameter injection, and just retrieve our source value directly in scoped definition.

```dart
var a = koin.get<A>()
var b = a.scope.get<BofA>()
expect(b.a, a);
```
:::note
> Difference between `getSource()` and `get()`: getSource will directly get the source value. Get will try to resolve any definition, and fallback to source
value if possible. `getSource()` is then more efficient in terms of performances.
:::


### Scope Linking

Koin Scope API allow you to link a scope to another, and then allow to resolve joined definition space. Let's take an example.
Here we are defining, 2 scopes spaces: a scope for A and a scope for B. In A's scope, we don't have access to C (defined in B's scope).

```dart
module()..single((s) => A())
  ..scope<A>((scope) {
    scope.scoped((s) => B());
  })..scope<B>((scope) {
    scope.scoped((s) => C());
  });
```

With scope linking API, we can allow to resolve B's scope instance C, directly from A'scope. For this we use `linkTo()` on scope instance:

```dart
var a = koin.get<A>();
// let's get B from A's scope
var b = a.scope.get<B>();
// let's link A' scope to B's scope
a.scope.linkTo(b.scope);
// we got the same C instance from A or B scope
expect(a.scope.get<C>(), b.scope.get<C>());
```

### Scope callback -- TODO
